# sheetmetalnewsscraper
A small widget that can scrape the most recent articles from Fractory.com and TheFabricator.com.(10 articles from each site). Can be extended to other sites. Useful for sheetmetal enthusiasts who want to be informed about latest development in sheet-metal-technology. Opens link in the browser. Uses tkinter,requests, bs4 and webrowser. Need to run GUI.py for the graphical interface.


Future Update: Trying to send wrap it as an executable file so that it can be installed in Windows OS.
